<p>Galway is currently in a bid to become the cultural capital of Europe which is a very high honor and will bring some of the biggest European events to our city. This app is to help any first time tourists or students find the best Galway has to offer. </p>

 <p>I hope you enjoy the guide. For the future I plan to have one designed for other Irish cities</p>
